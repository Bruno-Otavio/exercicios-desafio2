            I am a very passionate person, when I focus on any topic, I enter in
            a flow state and that's where I learn the most. I am very patient
            too, some of my friends think that I'm often too patient, but I like
            how I am.

              My interest in learn software development / web development
              started at a young age, I remember it clearly when I was searching
              on the internet how to create my own website, just because I
              was curious.

              One of muy hobbies is gaming, it is something I can talk about
              for hours and not get tired. My passion started very early,
              playing games on my PlayStation 2, after some time, my mother
              bought for me my first laptop as a gift and then, I went deep into
              my passion.

                One game I like a lot is Persona 4, a JRPG with an amazing story and
                characters, that I have played for hours and I love the most.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          To my future, I want to be able to work with software development
          while I can pursuit my hobbies. I want to focus on the back-end part
          of the development or, while it may not be my main objective, be able
          to work with game development.
